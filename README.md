# Data4Good Volunteering: Git Advanced

## Exercise Merge Conflicts
For this exercise, the **team members take turns**. Each team member should try to run both scenarios. **Decide as a team** how each conflict should be resolved and if the workflow (`rebase` vs. `merge`) was a good option to choose.

---

## Workflow

1. make a change (locally) to the section below (**Colab Area**)

2. commit and push changes

3. follow the instructions:
  - run `git fetch`
  - run `git rebase -i`
  - chose option / resolve conflict

4. push changes to remote
