# Data4Good Volunteering: Git Advanced

Welcome to the Git Advanced Workshop!

This workshop is intended to teach you the **basics of collaborating as a team on versioned files** and what role **git** plays in all this. We will talk about some mental models in the git-world, that enable this collaboration and what is important to keep in mind when working with it as a team.

There are several hands-on exercises that will help us build a better understanding of the concepts and how it works in practice. 

## Setup

To get started, create a local copy of this repository using a terminal and the following command:
